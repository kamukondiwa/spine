Backbone magic:

Removes the need to update ui elements manually when your data changes.
	Models represent your data.
	Multiple views can use a model as data.
	When a ui action that changes the model occurs events are triggered to signify this and all appropriate view can respond to the change by updating themselves accordingly.
